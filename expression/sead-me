This schema is some codee.  When coded (by coder), it produces
. a cleaner
. a tokeniser
. a parser
. a linker (tbc)
. a compiler (tbc)
for use on some expressees.

For reference, the codement, in cdt, has been stored in Subversion.

This project has its own templates, which are, at the time of writing, identical to those used in codee/schema/coder.  (In other words, a solution is required for the problem of template duplication.)  There is a similar situation with set-up and symbols.
