How to ...

In the template, create a line containing the path, relative from the inc-folder, to the inc-file.  For example, the path to this inc-file, relative from the inc-folder, is read-me/how-to.  Therefore, for this text to be in the content of the files generated to the cmt-folder, there must be a line in the content of a tpt-file containing the string read-me/how-to.

In order for this process not to wreak havoc on your generated coded, by blindly replacing matching strings in the generated code, each source-target mapping is specified in tpt/index.  Why is a file stipulating some mappings housed with the templates and not with the mappings?  It is so because it is often desirable to obtain these mappings as a part of the generation process.
