What is ...

This sample project is codable, that is, it defines a schema to be consumed by Coder, which will compose the schema's template and mapping, to produce code.  This schema defines a general set of records.  It then defines some functions and procedures to map the general records to ones particular to the Java and SQL templates.



How to ...

Satisfy the following dependencies, to generate the code to the prompt
. jdk-1.6
. bash (cygwin?)
. lrbh-coder-0.4
. lrbh-recurser-0.6

The following are necessary to execute the SQL and JDBC components
. mysql-connector-java-5.1
. mysql-5.0

Install the project

  > pjt=~/project/codee-sample
  > svn export http://lrbh-svn.cvsdude.com/public/codee/schema/sample $pjt

Customise $pjt/envment to your system

  > source $pjt/envment

The following step displays the generated code at the prompt.  This is useful when developing a schema

  > $pjt/set-up

You will probably need to customise some of the files, before running the set-up to completion.  In

  $pjt/scm/tpt/sql/create
  $pjt/scm/tpt/java/src/[pkg:pkgz][pkg.folder][]/[cls:pkg.clsz][cls.name]Persistor.java[]

ensure that the user name and password are appropriate to your MySQL installation

The following step creates a folder called coded-sample and then invokes the creation, compilation and usage scripts

  > $pjt/set-up coded-sample

Compare the output of the above to

  > $pjt/set-up | coder-grep eg/Main
